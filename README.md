# CookieClicker
This web scraper uses the Selenium WebDriver framework to constantly click a cookie and perform upgrades as they become available.

The robot navigatates to <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker" target="_blank">a cookie clicker website</a> where normally, you would mindlessly click a cookie over and over gaining points. There are also upgrades which accelerate your cookie collecting pursuit. The program scrapes information from the webpage finding the location of the cookie on the screen, the number of cookies collected, and the price and location on the screen of upgrades. It then begins to constantly click the cookie and perform upgrades as they become available. The gifs below shows this.

After a number of cursor upgrades, the bot chooses the grandma upgrade as it becomes the cheapest option.
